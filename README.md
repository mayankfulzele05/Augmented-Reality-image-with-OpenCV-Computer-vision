# Augmented-Reality-image-with-OpenCV-Computer-vision

In this project we are going to implement a series of project files, where at the end we will make a Final Software which will be capable to take a picture from us and augment any 3-D model or any other picture to the live video stream.
The Project involves 3 steps: Feature detection, Feature matching, image augementation

Feature detection
It explains the concept of Feature Detection and Description.
Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) used, being Open Source.
Feature detected and marked as green points in the image (IMG_20230526_135552.jpg)

Feature matching
It explains the concept of feature matching.
Feature Matching Attained with FLANN Based Matcher
It matches the features from the image with realtime camera as shown below in the image.

Image augementation
computing the Homography Matrix and Augment Image on realtime frame
A image is taken like a card which is augmented on the another which can be seen below.
